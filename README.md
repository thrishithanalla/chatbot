| Mukesh Manepalli     | @MukeshManepalli   | Deep thinking (response generation by analyzing query in different perspectives and giving the final answer)                                                             |
| Thrishitha Nalla     | @trishitanalla     | Implemented Text-To-Speech (TTS) option, changed Speech-To-Text model to OpenAI. Tried to add context buffer handling but it is not working as every response is based on a single default PDF (c229); the model is not giving generalized answers to unknown context data. |
| Aakhil Mohammad      | @AakhilMohammad    | Added web search functionality                                                                                                                                           |
